AJ's Chromatic Aberration and Retro Video FX Plug-ins
Tested in version 2.10
------------------------------------------------------

These plugins allow you to apply basic chromatic aberration and a VHS-esque effect to your images (partially based on this tutorial: https://www.vitormach.dev/blog/2020/09/12/tutorial-vaporwave-vhs-effect-using-gimp)

--------------------------------------

How to install:
-Extract the .py files into the plug-ins folder of your GIMP user profile folder, which can be found in the following locations:
	
    Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10 (a.k.a. %APPDATA%/GIMP/2.10)
    Linux: /home/<username>/.config/GIMP/2.10 (a.k.a. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/GIMP/2.10)
    OSX: /Users/<username>/Library/GIMP/2.10/ or /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.10/ (depends on GIMP build). (a.k.a. NSApplicationSupportDirectory/GIMP/2.10)
-In Unix-like systems, make sure the .py files are executable
-If GIMP is open, close it and start it again.
-You will find the effects under Filters > Artistic
